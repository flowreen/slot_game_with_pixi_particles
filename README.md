Small project built from a basic Pixi JS template.
If run correctly with instructions below, it will display a casino slot reel with a spin/stop and a sound button like here:

clicking the spin button will start rotating the reel and replace the spin button with a stop button like here:

when reel rotation stops, i play three randomly positioned pixi particle explosions:

also clicking sound button will allow player to hear the button clicks, the reel stop sound and the congratulations sound that is triggered when particle explosions happen.
Enjoy!
